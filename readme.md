## Chatbase Hosting

This simple site is used to embed your Chatbase iframe. Simply go to `index.html` and replace the following:

1. Replace your iframe's `src` attribute with your own chatbase' iframe.
2. Replace the content of the `<title>` element with your own document title. This is what will be displayed on the browsers' title bar or tab.
3. Replace the content of the `<h2>` element with your page title (to be displayed on the site itself)

Then, enable Github Pages on your repository setting, selecting this branch (`main`) as your source site and click `save`.
